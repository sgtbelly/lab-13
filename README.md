![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) LAB - TOPIC
=================================================


## Before you begin
* You'll need to initialize this lab folder as a new node module, install your dependencies, setup your npm script commands, and pull in your config files
* You've been provided a server code with the authentication middleware, models and routes scaffolded in. There are some potential bugs and missing logic.
* Work with a partner!

## Assignment
###### Requirements
* Create a code/data path map of the authentication system on a whiteboard
* Print and document the code/data path from the source code provided 
* **CODE:** Protect the `/api/v1/:model/schema` route by requiring user authentication

###### Testing
* In addition to the current test suite, write a test to ensure that access to the protected route is restricted if you do not login with basic authentication or a bearer token

###### Stretch Goal:
* Add support for Basic and Bearer Authentication to RESTy 

##  Documentation
Include your travis badge at the top of your `README.md` file
In your `README.md`, describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and it's behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to add any additional information in your `README.md` that you would like.
Submit images of your whiteboard and a hard copy of the code map as part of this assignment. If you can take a clear picture of the code map, that will suffice.
